Why do programmers use pseudocode?

It helps develop algorithm; and it is simple so anyone can read it without having a knowledge of a specific language.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen.


Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
 
INPUT  two numbers
IF first number is greater than the second number
	PRINT the first number
ELSE IF second number is greater than the first number
	PRINT the second number
ELSE
	PRINT "Numbers are equal"



Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT numbers is empty
FOR 	counter = 0
	while counter is less than 100
	add 1 to counter
	
		PUSH counter to numbers
END FOR
PRINT numbers;

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT entry
INPUT phonebook
INIT phonebookMatch is empty
FOR 	counter = 0
	while counter is less than the length of the phonebook
	add 1 to counter

		IF phonebook with the index of counter matches entry
			PUSH phonebook with the index of counter to phonebookMatch
		END IF
END FOR
 
IF the length of phonebookMatch is 0 
	PRINT "Entry didn't match"
ELSE
	PRINT phonebookMatch


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function isGreater(x,y){
  if (x>y)
    {return x}
  else if (y>x)
    {return y}
  else
    {return "Numbers are equal"}
}


function printNumbers(){
  let numbers=[];
  for(let counter =1; counter <= 100; counter++){
      numbers.push(counter)
}
  return numbers

}

function phonebookEntry(entry, phonebook){
  let phonebookMatch=[];
  for (let counter =0; counter < phonebook.length; counter++){
    if (phonebook[counter] === entry){ phonebookMatch.push(phonebook[counter])}
     }
 return (phonebookMatch.length===0? "Entry didn't match":phonebookMatch)
}
