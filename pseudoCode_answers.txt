Why do programmers use pseudocode?

It helps develop algorithm; and it is simple so anyone can read it without having a knowledge of a specific language.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen.


Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
 
INPUT  two numbers
IF first number is greater than the second number
	PRINT the first number
ELSE
	PRINT the second number
END IF



Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT counter is 0
INIT total is empty
WHILE counter is less than 100
	ADD number to counter
	PUT number in total
END WHILE
PRINT total

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

INIT name is specfic entry
IF name matches a name in phonebook
	PRINT name
ENF IF
